These are my dotfiles. They might not be pretty, but they are mine.

This is the stuff I was running the last time I edited this readme file:

- **Window Manager:** [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)
- **Terminal:** [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- **Shell:** [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) with [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) as prompt
- **Editor**: [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- **Runner:** [rofi-wayland](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi)
- **Bar:** [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags/)/[Astal](https://aylur.github.io/astal/)
- **Theme:** [Gruvbox](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme)

All managed with NixOS and Home-manager.
